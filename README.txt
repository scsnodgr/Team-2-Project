- RUN on a Windows machine (MAC will crash when trying to click on the drop-down menu but will still work as long as it is not clicked on)
- Enter a terminal in the project directory (should contain laser-tag.py, python_trafficgenerator_v2.py, Audio, and photon.jpg)
- Run "python laser-tag.py" first, then run "python python_trafficgenerator_v2.py"

Note:
- This code requires you to have Pillow and supabase installed
  - To install these dependencies, go into a terminal and "pip install Pillow supabase"
- This code also requires a specific version of playsound (the most current version will not work properly)
