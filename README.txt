To run the project:
- Enter a terminal in the project directory (should contain player-entry.py and photon.jpg)
- Run "python player-entry.py"

Note:
- This code requires you to have Pillow and supabase installed
  - To install these dependencies, go into a terminal and "pip install Pillow supabase"
- Currently, the player entry screen will scale with screen scaling on Windows (i.e. program might look normal at 100% scale but be too big to fit on screen at 200% scale)
